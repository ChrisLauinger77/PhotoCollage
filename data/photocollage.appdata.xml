 <summary>Graphical tool to make photo collage posters</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   PhotoCollage allows you to create photo collage posters.  It assembles the
   input photographs you give it to generate a big poster.  Photos are arranged
   to fill the whole poster, however you can influence the algorithm to change
   the final layout.  You can also set a custom border between photos, and save
   the generated image in the resolution you want.
  </p>
  <p>
   The algorithm generates random layouts that place photos while taking
   advantage of all free space.  It tries to fill all space while keeping each
   photo as large as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   PhotoCollage does more or less the same as many commercial websites do, but
   for free and with open-source code.
